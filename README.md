# mnist-neural-net
This is my first neural network project! 
It's a fully connected neural network built from scratch using NumPy and Pandas to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
I implemented gradient descent for training, integrated accuracy tracking, and added visualization with Matplotlib to better understand model performance. 
The network learns from training data and can save its weights for future use, allowing continuous learning without restarting.
Throughout the training process, I experimented with different values for iterations and alpha (learning rate) to find the optimal settings for improving accuracy and stability. 

After fine-tuning, I successfully achieved 94.04% accuracy on the test dataset!

Additionally, I have included the trained modelâ€™s weights and biases, saved in .npy files, so the model can be loaded and used without needing to retrain from scratch.


Dataset Credit:
The MNIST dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.
